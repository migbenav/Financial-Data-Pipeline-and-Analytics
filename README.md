# Financial Data Pipeline & Risk Analytics Dashboard

---

### **1. Executive Summary: The Data-Driven Approach to Financial Analysis**

This project demonstrates a complete analytical workflow, from data ingestion to actionable insights. It addresses three core business questions by creating an automated data pipeline and a dynamic dashboard. By focusing on descriptive analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling, the project showcases the skills required to transform raw market data into a powerful tool for strategic decision-making.

### **2. The Business Problem: Beyond Simple Price Analysis**

Manual data analysis fails to capture the complexity and speed of modern financial markets. This project aims to solve three specific business challenges:

* **Understanding Risk and Volatility**: How can we systematically compare the risk profiles of different asset types (e.g., tech stocks vs. traditional industry stocks)?
* **Identifying Market Regimes**: Can we use data to objectively classify market conditions (e.g., high volatility, low volatility) and analyze asset performance within each regime?
* **Predicting Market Movements**: Can we predict the probability of a key price movement (e.g., a stock breaking above its 20-day average) using technical indicators?

### **3. Methodology: From Data to Insight**

This solution is a robust, end-to-end data pipeline designed to answer the business questions.

1.  **Automated Data Ingestion**: A Python script automates the collection of financial data from the Alpha Vantage API. This process is orchestrated by **GitHub Actions** to run daily, ensuring the data is always up-to-date.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: The raw data is enhanced with calculated features critical for analysis, such as moving averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility metrics.
3.  **Advanced Analytics**:
    * **Descriptive Analytics**: The dashboard will display key risk metrics like annualized volatility and drawdowns, visualized to tell a clear story about an asset's risk profile.
    * **Machine Learning**: A clustering algorithm will be applied to identify distinct market regimes based on historical data.
    * **Predictive Modeling**: A classification model will be used to predict the probability of a stock's price exceeding its 20-day moving average, using engineered features as predictors.
4.  **Interactive Dashboard**: The final application, built with **Streamlit** and connected to **Supabase**, will provide a user-friendly interface to visualize the results and explore the data.

### **5. Results and Recommendations**

*(This section will be updated upon completion of the dashboard.)*

The dashboard will present a clear, data-driven response to each business question. It will allow users to:

* Compare the risk of different assets, identifying a potential portfolio for a specific risk tolerance.
* Understand how an asset performs during different market conditions.
* Access a predictive model's probability score for a bullish price movement.

**Recommendations** will focus on potential project expansions, such as integrating alternative data sources or deploying more complex predictive models to enhance the analysis.
